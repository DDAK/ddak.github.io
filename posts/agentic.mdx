## I. Introduction

Modern supply chains are becoming increasingly complex and volatile, facing challenges from global disruptions, fluctuating demand, and the need for real-time visibility. Traditional methods, such as manual tracking and outdated systems, are no longer sufficient to handle these complexities. **Agentic AI offers a promising solution** by automating and optimising complex processes, and autonomously completing tasks efficiently. 

## II. Challenges in Modern Supply Chain Management

- **Market Volatility and Disruptions:** Unpredictable global events, natural disasters, pandemics, and geopolitical tensions cause significant delays and inefficiencies in supply chains. These disruptions make it difficult to maintain consistent operations and meet customer demands.
- **Demand Fluctuations:** Managing fluctuating customer demand requires real-time data analysis and agile responses to avoid stockouts or overstocking. Inaccurate demand forecasts can lead to both lost sales and excess inventory.
- **Inefficiencies of Traditional Systems:** Manual tracking, outdated inventory systems, and siloed data hinder efficient operations. These systems often rely on past data and result in inaccurate forecasts, as well as slow response times.
- **Lost Sales:** Delays in answering critical supply chain questions can result in a significant percentage of lost sales. 
- **Data Overload:** Procurement functions are often overwhelmed with data that is not used effectively to improve decision-making. This can lead to missed opportunities for cost savings and efficiency improvements.
- **Integration Issues:** Integrating advanced AI solutions with existing rule-based legacy systems presents a challenge. **Seamless integration** is crucial for leveraging AI without disrupting established workflows.

## III. Introduction to Agentic AI
Agentic AI uses AI agents to complete complicated and effort-intensive processes. These agents can break down assigned work into smaller parts and function autonomously to complete tasks in a highly efficient manner. They can perceive, reason, act, and learn without constant human guidance, which makes them ideal for handling complex tasks and streamline automation efforts and ensure efficient progress.

Unlike traditional AI or GenAI, which may require specific data and cannot act independently, **Agentic AI is capable of autonomous decision-making and action**. Agentic AI is capable of handling repetitive, data-intensive processes. Vanilla LLMs may lack the contextual knowledge of custom data to answer complex queries, which is where Agentic AI excels. 

## Core Components of AI Agents:
AI agents consist of Large Language Models (LLMs) for processing, memory to store and retrieve information, tools to perform actions, and knowledge to inform decision-making (planning).
    - **Memory** includes short-term memory for adhering to a plan and long-term memory for downstream processes to use upstream results. Short-term memory allows agents to access outputs within the context of a workflow, while long-term memory allows access to previously executed outputs.
    - **Tools** are executable functions or sub-flows that complete intermediate tasks. For example, tools can be used to fetch changelogs, read repository files, or interact with databases.
    - **Knowledge** is the data that agents use to perform tasks. This could be data extracted from sources like Logs, customer databases, or market reports, etc.

## Types of AI Agents:
    - **Simple Reflex Agents** make decisions based only on current observations, ignoring past inputs.
    - **Hierarchical Agents** use a layered tree structure where higher-level agents direct lower-level ones, which helps manage complexity. For example, a Product Manager agent can delegate tasks to a Developer agent. However, uni-directional communication between agents is more effective for automation than bi-directional communication in a hierarchical structure.
    - **Multi-Agent Systems** involve groups of agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. These are frequently used in distributed systems such as supply chain management networks.
    - **Custom-Agent Systems** involve groups of agents that collaborate to solve complex problems and are stitched together based on custom domain specific workflow.
